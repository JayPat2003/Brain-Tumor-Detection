# Brain-Tumor-Detection


## Overview
This machine learning project focuses on detecting brain tumors in medical images using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset of brain MRI scans and employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify the presence of tumors. By developing this tool, medical professionals can enhance the early diagnosis of brain tumors, enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

## Key Features
- Accurate brain tumor detection in MRI scans.
- Visualization of the detected tumors and their locations.
- User-friendly interface for inputting MRI images and obtaining predictions.
- Integration with a healthcare database for patient record management.
